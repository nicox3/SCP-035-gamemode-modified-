# SCP-035-gamemode-modified-
The SCP 035 modified gamemode made originally by: ShingekiNoRex

Notes: You NEED the Smod2 (https://github.com/Grover-c13/Smod2/releases/tag/3.1.10) and the gamemode manager (https://github.com/ShingekiNoRex/SCPSL-Gamemode-Manager).
-I am not the original author. I just made it (IMO) more fun to play.
-Some features that I had planned are not found here, why? Apparently the smod isn't there yet.
-If it wasn't apparent enough, this is a server-side plugin for SCP: Secret Laboratory.

Have fun! Nico.
